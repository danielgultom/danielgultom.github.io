# danielgultom.com / danielgultom.github.io

Note: this page was originally danielhamg.github.io but I switched the 
repository's ownership to my (now) main account, danielgultom.

I began this website since early 2018 (March) and I'm continuing to update it! I envision this site to be the place where I show my 
skills in programming through projects and share personal content. 

I'm only a sophomore so I'm still exploring what I like in the field of computer 
science, but I'm currently interested in web design/development, UI/UX, 
software engineering, and data science, and I'm definitely looking for 
opportunities to gain skills in those industries through internships/jobs. Please 
message me at daniel.gultom@berkeley.edu for any questions!
